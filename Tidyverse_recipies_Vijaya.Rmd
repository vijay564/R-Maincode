#**Title- Tidyverse Recipies**

##**Introduction**
>In this assignment we are trying some Tidyverse recipies. As part of this i would like to use unnest() function in tidyverse. 

##**Load Libraries**
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

##**unnest ()**

### Unnest is used when you want to make each list element its own row from a column with lists of items
unnest (data, ..., .drop = NA, .id = NULL, .sep = NULL, .preserve = NULL)

data - a data frame.
... - the columns to unnest; defaults to all list-columns
.drop - whether additional list columns should be dropped
.id - data frame identifier; creates a new column with the name .id, giving a unique identifier.
.sep - identify a separator to use in the names of unnested data frame columns, which combine the name of the original list-col with the names from nest data frame
.preserve - list-columns to preserve in the output

##**Example**

```{r}
biopics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vijay564/R-Maincode/master/tidyverse_recipies.csv") %>% 
    # Filter the "directors" column for entries that contain a comma -- that have more than one name
    filter(str_detect(director, ".\\,.")) %>%
    # Select a few columns of the dataframe for demonstration purposes
    select(title, country, director)           

head(biopics, 3) %>% 
    kable("html")  %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

# Unnest the "directors" col-list twice along two different separators
dir_unnest <- unnest(biopics, director = strsplit(director, ",")) %>% 
    unnest(director = strsplit(director, ":"))

# Remove the pattern of a space and the word "With"            
dir_unnest$director <- str_replace(dir_unnest$director, "[[:space:]]With", "")

head(dir_unnest, 8) %>% 
    kable("html")  %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

```
