## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Load necessary packages
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)

# Establish DB connection
mydb = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='lakshmi564', dbname ='cuny', host='localhost', port = 3306)

# Test connection
mydb

# Query to fetch usertable data and assign to query1
query1 <- dbGetQuery(conn = mydb, statement = "SELECT * from usertable")
query1

# Query to fetch movie_ratings data and assign to query2
query2 <- dbGetQuery(conn = mydb, statement = "SELECT * from movie_ratings")
query2

# Query to join usertable and movie_rating and get the resultset
query3 <- dbGetQuery(conn = mydb, statement = "select A.user_id, A.Firstname, A.Lastname, B.movie_id, B.movie_name, B.movie_rating
 from usertable A, movie_ratings B where A.user_id = B.user_id ")
query3

# Query to use database functions and get average ratings for movies
query4 <- dbGetQuery(conn = mydb, statement = "select movie_id, round(avg(movie_rating),2) from cuny.movie_ratings group by movie_id")
query4

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
