## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
mushroomds <- read.csv(url("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/agaricus-lepiota.data"), header = FALSE, sep =",")
mushroomds <- mushroomds[c(1,2,3,5)]
head(mushroomds, 20)
colnames(mushroomds) <- c("Class","Shape","Continent","Soiltype")

levels(mushroomds$`Class`) <- c(levels(mushroomds$`Class`), c("Poisonous","Edible"))
mushroomds$`Class`[mushroomds$`Class` == "p"] <- "Poisonous"
mushroomds$`Class`[mushroomds$`Class` == "e"] <- "Edible"

levels(mushroomds$`Shape`) <- c(levels(mushroomds$`Shape`), c("Bell","Tilted","Curved","Cone","Convex","Flat"))
mushroomds$`Shape`[mushroomds$`Shape` == "b"] <- "Bell"
mushroomds$`Shape`[mushroomds$`Shape` == "c"] <- "Tilted"
mushroomds$`Shape`[mushroomds$`Shape` == "f"] <- "Curved"
mushroomds$`Shape`[mushroomds$`Shape` == "k"] <- "Cone"
mushroomds$`Shape`[mushroomds$`Shape` == "s"] <- "Convex"
mushroomds$`Shape`[mushroomds$`Shape` == "x"] <- "Flat"

levels(mushroomds$`Continent`) <- c(levels(mushroomds$`Continent`), c("Asia", "America","Australia","Europe"))
mushroomds$`Continent`[mushroomds$`Continent` == "s"] <- "Asia"
mushroomds$`Continent`[mushroomds$`Continent` == "y"] <- "America"
mushroomds$`Continent`[mushroomds$`Continent` == "f"] <- "Australia"
mushroomds$`Continent`[mushroomds$`Continent` == "g"] <- "Europe"

levels(mushroomds$`Soiltype`) <- c(levels(mushroomds$`Soiltype`), c("Blacksoil", "Redsoil"))
mushroomds$`Soiltype`[mushroomds$`Soiltype` == "t"] <- "Blacksoil"
mushroomds$`Soiltype`[mushroomds$`Soiltype` == "f"] <- "Redsoil"

head(mushroomds, 10)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
