## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
## Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
## Used three main functions for tidying data: gather(), separate() and spread()

# Read CSV file 

library(tidyr)

flightData<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vijay564/R-Maincode/master/week5.csv", header= TRUE,sep=",",na.strings = "?",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
flightData

# Eliminate Blank Row
flightData <- flightData[c(1,2,4,5), ]
flightData

# Rename missing Headers 
names(flightData)[names(flightData) == "X"] <- "Airline"
names(flightData)[names(flightData) == "X.1"] <- "Arrival"

# Repeating missing Airline name
flightData[2, 1] <- "ALASKA"
flightData[4, 1] <- "AM West"
flightData

# Use gather() function to takes multiple columns and gathers them into key-value pairs. It makes “wide” data longer.
tidy <- gather(flightData, "City", "Count", 3:7) 
head(tidy)

# Use gather() function to takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs. It makes “long” data wider
tidy <- spread(tidy, "Arrival", Count)
tidy

# Using select function which focus on subset of variables or we can use minus to hide it
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
head(select(tidy, Airline))

head(select(tidy, -Airline))

# Use filter function
filter(tidy,Delayed==62)

# Use Mutate function to add new columns 
tidy=mutate(tidy,Total = Delayed + `On Time`)
head(tidy)

## Compare arrival delays for airlines
# AM West is getting delayed most of the times
library(ggplot2)


tidy <- mutate(tidy, Total = Delayed + `On Time`, PercentDelayed = Delayed / Total * 100)
tidy <- arrange(tidy, City, PercentDelayed)

ggplot(tidy,aes(x=City,y=PercentDelayed,fill=factor(Airline)))+
    geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")

tidy

# Use Summarise function which reduce each group to a smaller number of summary statistics
# On High Level the Overall delay of Alaska airline is delayed by 11% and AM West delayed by 18%
delays <- tidy %>% group_by(Airline) %>% summarise(MeanPercent = round(mean(PercentDelayed), 0))
delays
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
